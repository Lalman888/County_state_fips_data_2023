## Introduction

The Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) are used to uniquely identify geographic regions in the U.S. This dataset includes the latest FIPS codes for all U.S. counties, county equivalents, and states. The data is valuable for anyone working with geographic data, including software developers, geographers, or analysts who need to use FIPS codes in their applications.

## Data Structure

The data is organized in a CSV format with the following fields:

- **State FIPS Code**: The unique 2-digit code for each U.S. state.
- **County FIPS Code**: The unique 5-digit code for each county within a state.
- **County Name**: The name of the county.
- **State Name**: The name of the state.

Example:

| State FIPS Code | County FIPS Code | County Name       | State Name  |
|-----------------|------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| 06              | 001              | Alameda           | California  |
| 12              | 003              | Broward           | Florida     |
| 36              | 061              | New York County   | New York    |
